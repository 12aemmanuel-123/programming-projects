      <h1>What is computer programming</h1>
      <p class="program">
        Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of
        instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform
        tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
        specifications step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing
        code in one or more programming languages.

      <p class="quote">
        <strong>Programming Languages</strong> are described in terms of their
        syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), <br />
        usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features
        such as a type <br />
        system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation
        of a programming <br />
        language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter
        or a compiler. <br />
        An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler
        produces an executable program.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Early developments</h3>
      <p class="history">
        The first programmable computers were invented at the end of the 1940s,
        and with them, the first programming languages. The earliest computers
        were programmed in first-generation programming languages (1GLs),
        machine language (simple instructions that could be directly executed by
        the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not
        portable between different computer systems.[12] In order to improve the
        ease of programming, assembly languages (or second-generation
        programming languages—2GLs) were invented, diverging from the machine
        language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they
        did not increase portability.[13]
      </p>

      <p class="history">
        Initially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human
        resources were cheaper. Therefore, cumbersome languages that were
        time-consuming to use, but were closer to the hardware for higher
        efficiency were favored. The introduction of high-level programming
        languages (third-generation programming languages—3GLs)—revolutionized
        programming. These languages abstracted away the details of the
        hardware, instead being designed to express algorithms that could be
        understood more easily by humans. For example, arithmetic expressions
        could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into
        machine code that the hardware could execute.[13] In 1957, Fortran
        (FORmula TRANslation) was invented. Often considered the first compiled
        high-level programming language, Fortran has remained in use into the
        twenty-first century. 1960s and 1970s.
      </p>

      <p class="history">
        Two people using an IBM 704 mainframe—the first hardware to support
        floating-point arithmetic—in 1957. Fortran was designed for this
        machine.[17][16] Around 1960, the first mainframes—general purpose
        computers—were developed, although they could only be operated by
        professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and instructions were
        input by punch cards, meaning that no input could be added while the
        program was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are
        designed for minimal interaction. After the invention of the
        microprocessor, computers in the 1970s became dramatically cheaper. New
        computers also allowed more user interaction, which was supported by
        newer programming languages.
